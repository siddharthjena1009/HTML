    <h1><strong><em>S = vᵢt + ½at²: The Equation of Linear Motion</em></strong></h1>

    <p>
        The formula <em>S</em> = <em>vᵢ</em>t + ½<em>a</em>t² describes the motion of an object under constant acceleration. Here:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><em>S</em> represents the displacement,</li>
        <li><em>vᵢ</em> is the initial velocity,</li>
        <li><em>t</em> is the time,</li>
        <li><em>a</em> is the acceleration, and</li>
        <li>½<em>a</em>t² is the additional displacement due to acceleration.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        "An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an <u>external force</u>." Note: This equation was originally written in 1905.
